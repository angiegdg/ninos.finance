                        <p class="mb-5">ninos.finance – a sole proprietorship by Adriel Cedeno – has developed an Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Policy that meets legislative requirements and reflects management's principles on their approach to money laundering and terrorist financing risks posed to ninos.finance.<br><br>

                            ninos.finance is registered with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (“FINTRAC”) as a Money Service Business (“MSB”) and cooperates fully with FINTRAC and other law enforcement agencies upon request in all efforts to detect, prevent, and deter money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">1. The Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (“PCMLTFA”)</h2>
                        <p class="mb-5">In accordance with legislative requirements, ninos.finance has to fulfill certain record keeping, identification, and reporting requirements to FINTRAC standards and ninos.finance has implemented a compliance regime which includes: – AML Program oversight from the Chief Compliance Officer (Adriel Cedeno) and contracted law firms; – Periodic review, development and further implementation of compliance policies and procedures; – Executing Know Your Customer (“KYC”) procedures on all customers; – An assessment of our risks as it relates to money laundering and terrorist financing; – Monitoring of transactions by all staff for potentially suspicious or attempted suspicious activities for the purposes of management to file Suspicious Transactions Reports (“STR”); – Providing ongoing compliance training for all employees involved in any part of the transaction process to ensure understanding of their responsibilities under the Proceeds of Crime Act and Regulations in Canada – Periodic reviews of the compliance 
                            program to test its effectiveness in combating money laundering and terrorist financing at a minimum of every two years</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">2. ninos.finance's Chief Compliance Officer</h2>
                        <p class="mb-5">Under the PCMLTFA, ninos.finance has designated Adriel Cedeno as the compliance officer who is responsible for the implementation and oversight of ninos.finance' compliance program. Adriel Cedeno of ninos.finance has the authority and the resources to ensure the ongoing compliance of ninos.finance as it relates to the identification and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">3. Ongoing Monitoring of Business Relationships</h2>
                        <p>As per FINTRAC Guidance, business relationships are established once a client has an account with your organization. Alternatively, if an account is not necessary or present, a business relationship is defined when a client conducts two or more financial transactions within a five year period. ninos.finance considers all accounts/wallets to be business relationships and therefore must: – Collect and verify the identity of the individual; or, – Ascertain the existence and verification of a corporation/entity and it's beneficiaries In addition to the above, ninos.finance adheres to the following regulatory requirements: – Risk-rating all business relationships and adjusting their risk-rating as/if needed; – Conducting ongoing monitoring of the business relationship at an appropriate frequency according to the client's risk-rating; – Keeping a complete record of the measures that have been taken to monitor the relationship and the information we obtained as a result. Whenever necessary, ninos.finance may require its clients to provide additional documentation or information to confirm source of funds or the purpose of any transaction. ninos.finance compliance officer will review all transactions and specifically scrutinize transactions that trigger an alert and determine if the transaction is within the clients' stated activity before completing or releasing said transaction. In some cases, ninos.finance will require additional
                             information from the client such as source of income, proof of employment, nature of a client's business, as well as a review of any client's transaction history. If in the course of reviewing and monitoring, we identify unexplainable or unusual patterns or activity, we will work to obtain further information so that these questions are satisfactorily answered. ninos.finance may also report the activity internally to the compliance officer, Adriel Cedeno. At which point it is the responsibility of the compliance officer to maintain a record/log of all internally reported transactions and perform a review to determine if an STR is to be filed with FINTRAC. If ninos.finance cannot reach a clear understanding of the client's identify, or the sources and movement of funds, it may result in the account being permanently closed. This will be followed by terminating the relationship and de-activation of the account with ninos.finance while removing the right of re-opening a new account.</p>

                        <p>As a registered MSB with FINTRAC, ninos.finance is required to keep certain types of records depending on the client and transaction type – this included but is not limited to records of any STR's submitted to FINTRAC. There is no threshold, hence no minimum nor maximum value, for a suspicious transaction – any amount may trigger an alert. When ninos.finance has to send an STR to FINTRAC, reasonable measures must be taken in order to collect and verify the identify of the individual who conducted or attempted to conduct the transaction under investigation. ninos.finance is required to maintain an efficient record keeping system to enable FINTRAC to have access to the records in a timely fashion. Our records will always be kept for a 
                            minimum of 5 years, and organized in such a way that they can be provided to FINTRAC within 30 days of a request to examine them.</p>

                        <p>Prior to a client being able to perform a transaction through any of the services ninos.finance provides, ninos.finance must identify that client is in accordance with applicable regulations. ninos.finance has a policy which requires all customers to be “verified” prior to being able to participate in any form of transaction or service provided by ninos.finance. Accounts are only made available to Canadian residents with Canadian bank accounts in order
                             to mitigate against the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing activities. Customers may be verified by way of:</p>

                        <p>We ascertain and verify the identify of a client by referring to a government-issued ID which must be valid according to FINTRAC standards which is outlined in ninos.finance compliance procedures.

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">5.5 Keeping Client Identification Information Updated</h2>
                        <p>ninos.finance clients who present an elevated risk will have their client identification information updated at least every two years, or sooner depending on periodic evaluations. Client's who present an elevated risk include (but is not limited to) Politically Exposed Persons (“PEPs”) and in all of its legal forms. This is to be done by reviewing original identity or entity documents and recording the updated identification or information details for our files as appropriate.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">6. Suspicious Transaction Reports</h2>
                        <p>ninos.finance must report any transaction or attempted transactions where there are reasonable grounds to suspect it relates to money laundering or terrorist activity. There is no monetary threshold for what may constitute a suspicious transaction nor for submitting an STR. The compliance officer has the authority to file STRs with FINTRAC and is required to maintain a log of all reports filed in accordance with ninos.finance's record keeping procedures. Reasonable grounds to suspect a malicious transaction includes (but is not limited to) any form of tax evasion or Canadian regulation. As such, any transactions which raise suspicion of avoiding or evading tax payment enforces legal obligation upon ninos.finance to report the activity to FINTRAC.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">7.Terrorist Property Reporting and Sanctions Requirements</h2>
                        <p>There are two situations where we must send a terrorist property report to FINTRAC immediately: – Knowing that a property is owned or controlled by or on behalf of a terrorist or terrorist group; and, – Believing that a property is owned or controlled by or on behalf of a listed person. Where there are economic sanctions, ninos.finance is required to prohibit or restrict activities in accordance with the legal requirements. In some cases, ninos.finance may be required to freeze property, in addition to making reports to various government and law agencies.</p>
